/**
 * SECTION: kiro-messenger
 * @Short_description: KIRO RDMA Messenger
 * @Title: KiroMessenger
 *
 * KiroMessenger implements a generic messenging interface for KIRO RDMA
 * communication. A messenger can be started either as listening or connecting
 * side. However, after connecting, both sides are identical in functionality.
 * Messenger connections are allways only single-point-to-point.
